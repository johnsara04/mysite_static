            <h4>Current focus: Health and performance</h4>   
            <p>I came to Stanford with a goal to address problems in endurance sports, with a particular interest in female endurance athletes. Initially I focused on hormonal disruption that can lead to loss of the menstrual cycle and bone density loss that is associated with relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S). However, I realized a critical gap: while athletes are encouraged to maintain regular menstrual cycles, little research exists on managing menstrual symptoms that consistently are reported to affect training and competition, or how contraception impacts athletic physiology.</p>


            <p>Although we know menstrual cycles impact resting biometrics (see our <a href='publications'>review paper</a>), the effects on exercise performance and symptom associations remain unclear. Since endurance athletes typically log detailed training data with GPS devices and heart rate monitors, I aimed to leverage existing data to answer female health questions and personalize injury risk prediction</p>

            <p> <b> Smartwatch Study </b></p>
            <p>I developed a web app that interacts with the GarminConnect API, guiding participants through interactive labeling of their training data over two years (injuries, vacations, illness). The study included a prospective branch for menstruating females combining training data with monthly surveys on menstrual patterns, symptom impact, and contraceptive use over 6 months. The analysis goals are to:</p>

            <ol>
            <li>Allow female athletes to make informed choices when using hormonal contraception whether for cycle management, hormonal management or contraception.
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                   <li>Better quantify the impact of the menstrual cycle on heart rate for a given speed in female endurance athletes and assess any association with symptoms. Understanding what happens at baseline is a critical first step to improve intervention advice.</li>
                    <li>Assess how menstrual regularity affects injury risk and how this is affected by contraception. Although lack of menstrual cycle due to underfueling is known to increase risk, lack of menstrual cycle due to hormonal contraceptive use has not been investigated.</li>
                     <li>Evaluate contraception's impact on heart rate-speed relationships. Previous studies show combined pills raise resting heart rate but reduce cycle fluctuations. For athletes choosing contraception, the impact on physiology is an important consideration.</li>
             </ol>
            </li>
             <li>Use the training load data to reduce injury in both male and female athletes.
                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
             <li>Advance injury prevention by developing algorithms to predict individual injury risk (bone and soft-tissue) based on training load.</li>
            </ol>
             </li>
            </ol>

            <p> However this dataset also includes pre and post-pregnancy training data which we are looking to also analyse and collaborate on. </p>

            <h4>Collaborations</h4>
            <p>Stanford and the Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance provide excellent collaborative opportunities, particularly allowing me to extend my research into hormonal health-related projects.</p>
            <ul>
                    <li>Monitoring physiological changes in an amateur triathlete undergoing testosterone therapy.</li>
                    <li>Using data provided by WHOOP to investigate how biometrics, behaviours and symptoms interact in menstruating women and those undergoing the menopausal transition.
                    <li>Stress fractures occur in high incidence in runners and also in military training. I building a training data collection tool for the <a href='https://returntosportstudy.com'>Return to Sport study</a>, a collaboration including TRIA Orthopedics,The Canadian Sports Institute Pacific and the University of Oregon led by Dr Kristy Popp. This study will measure adherence to return-to-running protocols post-stress fracture as stage 1 before clinical trials to test efficacy of a novel drug to speed bone healing.</li>
                    <li>Organizing the All-Hands meeting for Trainees at the Inauguaral <a href='https://humanperformancealliance.org/2023-symposium/all-hands-meeting-2023/'>Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance</a> Research Symposium 2023, Stanford.</li>

            <h4>Researcher at Dynamic Metrics</h4>
            <p>I worked as a researcher at Dynamic Metrics, a start-up developing portable gait analysis and personalized rehabilitation for post-operative hip and knee replacement patients using modeling and machine learning. After attending their presentation at Imperial College London, I secured an internship that expanded my coding skills, introduced me to Python, and provided valuable industry mentorship. Following pandemic-related staff cuts, my adaptability led to multiple roles spanning musculoskeletal modeling, plugin development, web development, social media, and outreach.</p>

            <h4>Doctoral Student at Imperial College London</h4>
            <p>I completed a PhD with two main projects. The first, was a collaborative project between Texas A&M, Imperial College London and Imperial College Medicine with myself as the key investigator. This project involved collecting lymphatic vessels from ovarian cancer patients undergoing surgery and analysing gene expression, inflammatory status and prognosis (paper <a href='publications' id='vessels'>HERE</a>). My other project involved modeling immune cell response in lymph nodes (paper <a href='publications' id='ln'>HERE</a>) and allowed me to develop my coding skills in java, my analysis in matlab and introduced me to high performance computing. I also co-authored a <a href='publications' id='lymph'>review paper</a> regarding modelling the lymphatic system.</p>

            <h4>Hobbies and Interests</h4>
            <p>Outside of work, I love to run and much of my work is influenced by my personal experiences of the frustration of injury after injury and the lack of understanding around female athlete health.</p>

            <p>I took up running after high school and regularly compete in track and road events. I am in post-collegiate team Peninsula Distance Club, a diverse mix of young professionals that train hard while excelling at full time jobs and most importantly provide a like-minded community. Although never really a cyclist, Stanford's world-class cycling terrain quickly converted me. I've since finished a sprint, half-Ironman, and full Ironman to add to my prior olympic distance triathlon to complete the set!</p>

<h4>Translation and Outreach</h4>


<p>A huge motivation for my research was experiencing the lack of resources available regarding REDs 10 years ago and current lack of knowledge regarding managing hormonal health. This drives a core goal: translating our findings across all levels—from rigorous academic research to practical applications for clinicians, coaches, and athletes themselves.</p>

<p>While conducting technical research, I'm equally committed to making these insights accessible and actionable for everyone in the sports ecosystem:</p>
